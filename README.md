## Life Package

Playing around with the front end. My FE will be totally separate from the BE, with a single login entry point.
Admin user.. just me, will be recognized by the backend on login and directed to the admin panel.

Pretty fun.. I am trying to recreate some ofthe joy and mui elements. This is odd that I am enjoying this because I absolutely
loathe frontend work and design in particular. If I had a creative bone in my body maybe I could come up with some cool new looking elements.. but serioulsy, I am trying to come up with some sort of theme to use for this UI. I know this is counter productive, but I am doing this becasue I love programming. I do Indeed have a great idea that I want to bring to fruition, but at the moment, I am in no hurry.
