## Life Package/After Life Package

I'm not building this to get rich, I dont even care if it makes $$. It's something I feel is needed, and I have a keen idea on how to implement it. It may save some lives, and it may give some people a chance to have the last word when they do die. It's all in my head right now. I desperately need to sit down and write out exactly how it will work and what its actually for. I'm on it, I just have not done it yet. I don't know why. I can see it in my head. The entire structure of the system and how I want it to work. I know it makes no sense. but it seems to be my process. 

I don't enjoy UI work. I'm terrible at UX. But I'm starting to like parts of it and I'm just going by what I've seen, and experienced on the web with products I have used, and by seeing others work. I'm building it in React. Using AI to generate most of the components. I am just fumbling my way through the design of this thing. I'll never be happy with it so I'm just getting it done. If this project happens to take off one day, Then I'll dig deeper but for now. It's a start to a functional product. I may break this down and rebuild it with a [tool](https://github.com/ddcroft73/create-react-mini) I made to make React apps without all the dependencies. It's a bit finiky, and a distraction but it was working pretty well when I quit with it.

### Just use a CSS framework, or a template!

For me it's easier not to use something like Tailwind or Bootstrap. I have no plans on learning that shit. I'd rather use straight CSS. It looks easier than dealing with all those fucking classes. React lets me do some programmig and programming is why I'm even buildoing a `SaaS`. God I hate saying `SaaS`. I can get behind the way a React component works. It's a really cool design. Build it all in a function, set up state if needed, handle any input, do some other cool things, and then return the interface. SO n much more fullfilling than Copying and pasting huge patches of HTML, and trying to remeber all that ugly markup. I'll take my time. I have no deadline. Besides. I'm doing this to learn, structure a system from the bottom up (programming), and for the coding. 

### Progress:

Right. So at some ppint I need to add Dark\light Mode. I have the theme infrastructure laid out, but at some point I just said fuck it and started too just use the colors i would if itwere in dark mode. Seriously my plan is to get the whole user onboarding componets up and working and then I'll go back to it. Thats where I am now. User registration, login, 2FA, verify password, password recovery. THese are things I'm working on now.

### 11/23/23
- **Login**: The login screen is simple. I built some components to mimic MUI `Paper`, and `Input`. I mayat some pint impor the actual library, but I actually omly need a few, and I've built them locally. ALl Code for handling the repsones is done.
- **Registration**: Currrently working on this one. I have the basics and I'll go back and tweak the UI. All the code for creating users as well as handing the responses is done.
- **Two Factor Auth**: I've built the UI componet. No code yet.
- **Routing**: I jave set up the routing.ALl it needs is more... routes.


### TODO:
- A landing page to see if there is any interest. I should have done this ages ago, but if I'm being honest. It's the content that scares me half to death. I havent hashed it all out as to how it should appeal to the general public. I am going to us AI to help me pinpoint whats what, and as soon as I just start it, it'll be done. just gotta get to it.. just gotta do it!
