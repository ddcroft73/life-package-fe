### Elements:
These are the buildong blocks of my components. I'm basically copying some of the mui elements and putting my own spin on them. I don't want to have to worry about any dependency issues if possible, and this has been a fun exercisr=e with ChatGPT. Yep, it is buildong the initial elements and I'm tweaking them. I'm not a front end guy and I'm hoping I dont fall in love with it because it is becoming quite fun. That being said, I AM NOT a designer. so I'm sure my UI/UX dynamics are laughable. I', just bsically copying whay I like on the net from all over. opefully my work will prove adequate, bordering on not bad. That's enough :)

The Components I am building myself. No AI, or as little as posible. I kind of have a dark mode in mind... working it all out. Hell, I'm not even 100 on the fucking UI at this point anyway, ha! "I'm going to let it happen organically... yes, organically, mmmmmmm." -FrontEnd Design Guy
