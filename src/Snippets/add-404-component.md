Ah, I see. It sounds like you're using React Router v6, where some significant changes were introduced, including the replacement of `<Switch>` with `<Routes>` and the removal of `<Redirect>`. Let's update the approach for implementing a "404 Not Found" page and the route configuration to align with React Router v6.

### Step 1: Create the 404 Component

This step remains the same. You create a component to display when a route is not found.

```javascript
// NotFoundPage.js
import React from 'react';

const NotFoundPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>404 - Not Found!</h1>
    <p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
  </div>
);

export default NotFoundPage;
```

### Step 2: Update Route Configuration for React Router v6

In React Router v6, the `<Routes>` component replaces `<Switch>`, and routes are now defined using `<Route>` elements with `element` props. The `<Redirect>` component is no longer used; instead, you use the `useNavigate` hook for redirection.

Here's how you can configure your routes:

```javascript
// App.js or your routes file
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import NotFoundPage from './NotFoundPage';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      {/* ... other routes ... */}
      <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
    </Routes>
  </Router>
);

export default App;
```

In this setup, `<Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />}>` acts as a catch-all route. Any URL not matching the preceding routes will render the `NotFoundPage` component.

### Handling Redirections

If you need to handle redirections (previously done using `<Redirect>`), you can now use the `useNavigate` hook in your components. Here's a quick example:

```javascript
// SomeComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const SomeComponent = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleRedirect = () => {
    navigate('/some-path'); // Redirect to '/some-path'
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... your component logic ... */}
      <button onClick={handleRedirect}>Go somewhere</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SomeComponent;
```

With these adjustments, your routing should align with React Router v6, and you'll be able to implement a functional 404 page and other navigational elements according to this updated framework.
