I need to figure out how to save the logon data if there are multiple users on the same computer.
  ex. I have an Admin and a User account. But on successful login, they are overwritten.
  solution: Save the data under the username and not 'userData' This way every user can have their 
  own access  DONE

  username and passwordvalidation

  test the handleRememberMe code isEmailAddress() to make sure it is acting right when the user tries to save 
  an invalid email

  code in hidden divs to be exposed when user enters failed login attempts

  I need to come up with a more clever deterrent to brute force attacks.  
     after 3 attempts impose a delay of 5 minutes
     after 6 attempts impose a delay of 30 minutes
     after 9, lovked out because yopur ass is up to no good. 
     
  Build an Admin PIN Component
  set up routing.
